## Finalization

- After implementation, review the changes again and avoid unnecessary modifications.
- Report that `pnpm lint` and `pnpm build` have succeeded, and summarize any outstanding or additional items for confirmation at the end.
- If the request is ambiguous, ask only the minimum necessary questions and proceed autonomously otherwise.
